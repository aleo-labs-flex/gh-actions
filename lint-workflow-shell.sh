# lint-workflow-shell.sh — shellcheck the shell embedded in workflow and action
# YAML, which nothing else looks at.
#
# `run:` blocks are shell scripts that happen to live inside YAML, so no linter
# sees them by default. The blocks here are not trivial: start-runner.yml
# carries most of the repo's trickiest shell -- a retry loop, a case dispatch on
# AWS error strings, functions. That is exactly the kind of code that
# accumulates quoting bugs unnoticed.
#
# Blocks containing `${{ }}` are skipped rather than mangled: GitHub expands
# those before bash ever sees them, and they are not valid shell. Pass values in
# through `env:` instead of interpolating them into the script, and the block
# stays lintable -- which is why every block here does that.
